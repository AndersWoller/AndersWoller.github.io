<h2> Distributive Politics in Competitive Vote Markets -- Evidence from Uganda </h2>
w. Horacio Larreguy

<p style="font-size:12px"> Does political competition deter clientelism by encouraging politicians to rely on public goods provision? While local public goods, in theory, is a more cost-effective strategy to generate political support among large groups, studies have found that political competition intensifies clientelism. This paper studies the question in Uganda where clientelism is widespread and political competition between candidates is increasing. We rely on the universe of public expenses, down to village-level, generated by national and sub-national government between 2012 and 2018 ($N=380,000$). The official voter registers allow us to link villages to their respective polling station electoral results. The extent of clientelism is measured using a high density survey ($N=30,000$) collected during the 2016 general elections campaign. We identify effects of local political competition using a shift-share instrument leveraging how positive shifts in NRMâ€™s nationwide popularity increase local political competition in opposition districts, but decrease political competition in regime strongholds. </p>




<h2> Speaking from Personal Experience with Public Services </h2>
w. Asmus Leth Olsen

<p style="font-size:12px"> Personal experience with public services plays a prominent role in both the scholarly debate, the media, and among laymen. However, the agreement about the importance of day-to-day experience is not matched with credible   secondhand accounts portray public services in one way, personal interactions may paint a very different picture. However, while the literature suggests that personal experience positively affects satisfaction, studies are challenged by issues of selection into public service usage versus non-usage. We study satisfaction with the public school specifically. We field a high-powered two-panel survey of parents to children in the pre-school and early school age ($N=10.000$). To remedy challenges to causality, we identify effects of personal experience in two ways. First, in a regression-discontinuity framework we exploit that Danish pupils begin school in the year they turn five, making December 31 a cutoff date assigning children to begin school in the current or subsequent year. Second, surveying parents twice we take advantage of the changed school enrollment status over time in a difference-in-differences framework. </p>
