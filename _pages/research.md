I hold a PhD and an MSc in political science from the University of Copenhagen as
 well as an MSc in comparative politics from the London School of Economics and Political Science. In 2019 I
 was a Fulbright visiting scholar at Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science. I am currently
 employed as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Copenhagen. In collaboration with Asmus Leth Olsen, I
 investigate whether information provision affects choice of and satisfaction with public services using field and natural experiments.
