I am a behavioral scientist applying field and survey experiments and computation approaches to describe and understand social and political phenomena. My current
projects seek to understand how individuals process factual information, how individuals generalize from anecdotal evidence, and how individuals act upon factual information.
In collaboration with unions and nonprofits, I have designed and implemented large-scale information campaigns as field experiments to study public
satisfaction with the bureaucracy and crime misperceptions.

I am a keen user of R stats and I have taught courses on statistics and programming in addition to substantive courses on comparative politics
to undergraduate and graduates.


<h2> Background </h2>

well as an MSc in comparative politics from the London School of Economics and Political Science. In 2019 I
was a Fulbright visiting fellow at Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science and I was a visiting scholar
at The Center on the Politics of Development, UC Berkeley. I am currently employed as a
postdoctoral fellow at the University of Copenhagen and part of the Behavioral and Experimental
