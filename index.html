<p style="font-size:15px"> Around the world, electoral playing fields are skewed towards the incumbent regime.
  My research describes <i>how</i> the electoral playing is skewed by combining the study of clientelism and the study of institutional manipulation.
  Specifically, I study the electoral infrastructure - the institutions in place to organize elections - and ask questions like:

  - What preferences do authoritarian regimes have over different electoral systems?
  - Do authoritarian regimes have in interest in increasing or decreasing the electorate's ease of voting?
  - Does the electoral infrastructure shape the clientelistic strategies of parties in power?

  In a different strand of work, I am engaged with how to improve public sector accountability through the provision of performance
  information to citizens using field-experiments.</p>
