<p style="font-size:15px">  I am a social data scientist studying electoral corruption, fraud, and the bureaucracy.
I analyze large, complex administrative data, including granular polling station results, censuses, voter registers, public budgets, and surveys often with tens of thousands of observations.
In collaboration with unions and non-for-profits, I have recently designed and implemented large-scale field experiments to study public
satisfaction with the bureaucracy and crime misperceptions.

<p style="font-size:15px">
I am a keen user of R stats and I have taught courses on statistics and programming in addition to substantive courses on comparative politics
to undergraduate and graduates.


<h2> Background </h2>

<p style="font-size:15px"> I hold a PhD and an MSc in political science from the University of Copenhagen as
well as an MSc in comparative politics from the London School of Economics and Political Science. In 2019 I
was a Fulbright visiting fellow at Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science and I was a visiting scholar
at The Center on the Politics of Development, UC Berkeley. I am currently employed as a
postdoctoral fellow at the University of Copenhagen and part of the Behavioral and Experimental
Public Administration Lab (<a href="https://politicalscience.ku.dk/research/bepal/">BEPAL</a>).
I previously held a position as project scientist at Uber Denmark.</p>
