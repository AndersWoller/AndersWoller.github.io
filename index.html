<p style="font-size:15px"> Around the world, electoral playing fields are skewed towards the incumbent regime.
  My research investigates <i>how</i> the electoral playing is skewed by combining the study of clientelism and the study of institutional manipulation.
  Specifically, I study the electoral infrastructure - the institutions in place to organize elections - and ask questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <p style="font-size:15px"> What preferences do authoritarian regimes have over different electoral systems? </p></li>
  <li> <p style="font-size:15px"> Do authoritarian regimes have in interest in increasing or decreasing the electorate's ease of voting?</p></li>
  <li> <p style="font-size:15px"> Does the electoral infrastructure shape the clientelistic strategies of parties in power?</p></li>
</ul>
  <p style="font-size:15px"> I study these questions using administrative data, including polling station results, censuses, and voter registers, in addition to surveys.
    In a different strand of work, I am engaged with how to improve public sector accountability through the provision of performance
  information to citizens using field-experiments.</p>
