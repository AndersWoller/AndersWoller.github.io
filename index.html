<p style="font-size:16px"> In countries around the world, the electoral playing field is skewed towards the incumbent regime.
  My research describes <i>how</i> the electoral playing is skewed by combining the study of clientelism and the study of institutional manipulation.
  Specifically, I study the electoral infrastructure -- the institutions in place to organize elections -- and ask questions like: what preferences do authoritarian regimes
  have over different electoral systems? Do authoritarian regimes have in interest in increasing or decreasing the electorate's ease of voting?
  And how does the electoral infrastructure shape the clientelistic strategies of parties in power?</p>

  <p style="font-size:16px">My research suggests that electoral institutions from the electoral system to the
  decision of adding more polling venues matter. In other words, manipulating the electoral infrastructure
  has measurable impact on the incumbent's electoral prospects. However, I also show that different institutions come with
  both advantages and disadvantages. Incumbents thus face trade-offs in their efforts to design the most favorable electoral landscape.</p>

<p style="font-size:12px"> I hold a PhD and an MSc in political science from the University of Copenhagen as
  well as an MSc in comparative politics from the London School of Economics and Political Science. In 2019 I
  was a Fulbright visiting scholar at Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science. I am currently
  employed as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Copenhagen. In collaboration with Asmus Leth Olsen, I
  investigate whether information provision affects choice of and satisfaction with public services using field and natural experiments.</p>
