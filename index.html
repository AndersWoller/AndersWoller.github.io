<h2> Bio <h2>

I hold a PhD and an MSc in political science from the University of Copenhagen, as well as an MSc in comparative politics from the London School of Economics and Political Science.
I am currently employed as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Copenhagen. In collaboration with Asmus Leth Olsen, I investigate XX using field and natural experiments.
