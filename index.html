<p style="font-size:15px"> I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Copenhagen. I study electoral corruption, electoral systems,
clientelism, and institutional manipulation. I analyze large, complex administrative data, including
granular polling station results, censuses, voter registers, and official budgets. In collaboration with external partners, I have
recently designed and implemented large-scale field experiments in Denmark to study satisfaction with the bureaucracy and how to correct
misperceptions with statistics. I am a keen user of R stats.


<h2> About me </h2>

I hold a PhD and an MSc in political science from the University of Copenhagen as
well as an MSc in comparative politics from the London School of Economics and Political Science. In 2019 I
was a Fulbright visiting fellow at Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science and I have
previously been invited as a visiting scholar at Center on the Politics of Development, UC Berkeley. I am currently employed as a
postdoctoral fellow at the University of Copenhagen and part of the Behavioral and Experimental
Public Administration Lab <a href="https://politicalscience.ku.dk/research/bepal/">(BEPAL)</a>.</p>
