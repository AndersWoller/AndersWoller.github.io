<p style="font-size:20px"> In countries around the world, the electoral playing field is skewed towards the incumbent regime.
  My research seeks to describe <i>how</i> the electoral playing is skewed. I study the electoral infrastructure --
  the institutions in place to organize elections -- and ask questions like: what preferences do authoritarian regimes
  have over different electoral systems? Do authoritarian regimes have in interest in increasing or decreasing the electorate's ease of voting?
  And how does the electoral infrastructure shape the strategies of parties in power?</p>

  <p style="font-size:20px">My research suggests that electoral institutions from the electoral system to the
  decision of adding more polling venues matter. In other words, strategically designing the electoral infrastructure
  has measurable impact on the incumbent's electoral prospects.  </p>
