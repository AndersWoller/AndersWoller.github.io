<h2> Bio </h2>

<p style="font-size:15px"> I hold a PhD and an MSc in political science from the University of Copenhagen as
  well as an MSc in comparative politics from the London School of Economics and Political Science. In 2019 I
  was a Fulbright visiting scholar at Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science. I am currently
  employed as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Copenhagen. In collaboration with Asmus Leth Olsen, I
  investigate XX using field and natural experiments.</p>
