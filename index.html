<p style="font-size:15px">  I am a social data scientist studying electoral corruption, fraud, and the bureaucracy.
I analyze large, complex administrative data, including granular polling station results, censuses, voter registers, and public budgets.
In collaboration with unions and non-for-profits, I have designed and implemented large-scale field experiments in Denmark to study public 
satisfaction with the bureaucracy and crime misperceptions.

<p style="font-size:15px"> In my work I use a range of supervised machine learning models to classify observations, fx with respect to local representation
in parliamentary speeches; the partisanship of radio stations; and respondents' preferred economic solution to COVID in open-text format.
I am a keen user of R stats. I have taught courses on statistics and programming in addition to substantive courses on comparative politics
to undergraduate and graduates and have supervised masters theses.
