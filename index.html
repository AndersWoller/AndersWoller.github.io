<p style="font-size:15px"> I am a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Copenhagen. I study electoral corruption, electoral systems,
clientelism, and institutional manipulation. I analyze large, complex administrative data, including
granular polling station results, censuses, voter registers, and official budgets. In collaboration with external partners, I have
recently designed and implemented large-scale field experiments in Denmark to study satisfaction with the bureaucracy and how to correct
misperceptions with statistics.

I am a keen user of R stats and I have taught courses on statistics and programming in addition to substantive courses on comparative politics
to undergraduate and graduates. I have also supervised masters theses.
